          <h2>1. Australian Prisoners by State</h2>
          <p>This map shows prisoner numbers across Australian states from 2013 to 2023, offering insights year by year.
            In 2023, Australia had a total of 41,929 prisoners. New South Wales consistently has the highest prisoner
            count, reflecting its large population. Interestingly, in recent years, Queensland has had more prisoners
            than Victoria, despite having a smaller overall population—a trend that raises questions about different
            state policies or crime patterns. Hover over each state to see the details.</p>

          <h2></br></br>2. Age and Imprisonment Trends</h2>
          <p>This heatmap visualizes the relationship between different age groups and crime types, providing a clear
            understanding of which demographics are most commonly associated with specific offenses. The darkest shades
            indicate the highest frequency of occurrences, revealing that acts intended to cause injury are the most
            prevalent crime. Notably, individuals aged 25 to 44 constitute the majority of offenders. Interestingly,
            homicide and sexual assault exhibit a relatively even distribution across age groups, suggesting that these
            crimes affect a wide range of ages without a strong age bias.

          <h2></br></br>3. Average sentence duration across states</h2>
          <p>This line graph presents the average sentence lengths for 16 crime types across various Australian states,
            including a national average. The y-axis indicates the number of years sentenced. Serious crimes, such as
            homicide and assault, fall into the top tier of severity, where sentencing durations remain fairly
            consistent across states. However, there is significant variability in the sentencing for homicide, ranging
            from 9.2 years in South Australia to 22.4 years in Tasmania. Also, incarceration for abduction/harassment
            fluctuates from 0 to 9.6 years. In contrast, less serious crimes tend to have more uniform sentences, with
            illicit drug use consistently attracting longer sentences across all states, averaging between 3.8 to 8.4
            years.

          <h2></br></br>4. Age Groups (2023)</h2>
          <p>These visualizations complement each other by illustrating the age distribution of inmates in 2023. The bar
            graph highlights that the 30-34 age group has the highest inmate count at 7,730, followed closely by the
            35-39 age group with 6,882 inmates and the 25-29 age group at 6,614. Together, these three age brackets
            account for a significant portion of the prison population. The pie chart reinforces this insight by
            displaying the proportional representation of these age groups. Individuals between the age of 25 and 39
            make up 50% of all inmates (see pie chart).

          <h2></br></br>5. Breakdown of Crime between 2013 and 2023</h2>
          <p>This representation tracks the shifts in crime proportions from 2013 to 2023, revealing notable trends over
            the decade. A significant increase in acts intended to cause injury, which rose by nearly 6%, is
            particularly concerning. Additionally, the proportion of sexual assault and related offenses increased from
            11.4% to 16.3%. In contrast, there have been decreases of approximately 3% each in the categories of
            unlawful entry with intent and robbery/extortion, indicating evolving crime patterns that may reflect
            broader societal changes.

  <h3>Remarks on data biases</h3>
  <div class="description">
    <h3><img src="./image/prison.jpg" alt="Jailcell window" width="600" height="400"></h3>
    <p>It's important to recognize that the data used in this analysis may have inherent biases. Different states in
      Australia may categorize crimes and convictions differently, which can lead to inconsistencies in how we interpret
      the data. For example, in visualization 3, where we see varying average sentences for crimes across states, this
      variation could stem from these differences in classification rather than actual discrepancies in crime severity.
      Essentially, the same type of crime might be classified under different categories or treated differently based on
      local laws, which can skew the overall picture.</br></br>
      Another example is the stacked area chart (final visualization) showing that incarceration rates have
      remained relatively stable over the years. This stability could suggest that law enforcement agencies are
      maintaining certain quotas for convictions and prosecutions. However, it’s essential to understand that these
      incarceration rates do not necessarily reflect changes in crime rates. Just because the number of people
      incarcerated remains constant, it doesn't mean that crime is happening at the same rate; rather, it might indicate
      that the justice system is processing cases in a consistent manner, potentially influenced by policies or resource
      allocations.</p>
